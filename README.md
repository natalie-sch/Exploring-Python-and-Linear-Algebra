# Exploring Python and Linear-Algebra

For our final exam project, we were tasked with three question to answer using Python 3 and the mathematical foundations from this course. More specifically, in this project assignment we refer
to topics within the field of programming in Python, including object-oriented programming, the python library Numpy as well as arrays and matrices in Python. On the other hand, we required
general Linear Algebra topics such as operations with matrices and vectors. In our report, we will be explaining each implementation in Python in detail, following the structure of the questions. The
Linear Algebra foundations we required are attached in the appendix.
